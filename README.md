# scbcn17-customer-segmentation
Customer Segmentation workshop for SoftwareCraftsmanship 2017 conference in Barcelona

## Description
Let's learn about useful Machine Learning algorithms, invoking them from common libraries (pandas & scikit-learn).

The workshop session starts with a brief introduction to ML (slides to be released after the workshop) and the different approaches we can apply. After that we will use this repository to practice exploring a real dataset, cleaning and optimizing the data, and using ML algorithms to find hidden insights.

NO need to know about maths, machine learning, nor python; this is an introductory but profitable workshop!

## Preparation
You will need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed in your machine.

We'll use a *docker container* that contains a data science stack, [jupyter/scypy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook), so you don't need to install anything locally.

This container comes with the tools we need for this workshop:
- **jupyter**: A web IDE that edits notebooks
- **python3**: The language that will use as interface 
- **numpy** and **pandas**: Python libraries to work with matrices and datasets
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Python ploting libraries to display data
- **scikit-learn**: Library with lots of Machine Learning algorithms

*PLEASE*: download this container before taking part in the workshop (just running a 'docker pull jupyter/scypy-notebook' in a terminal).

## Dataset
The workshop is based in a dataset that includes real purchases on ulabox website. This dataset will be released soon in CSV format.

## Running the notebook
Detailed instructions to be released soon.
